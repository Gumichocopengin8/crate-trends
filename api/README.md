# Crate Trends API

## Set up

- In api directory, run `HOST=127.0.0.1 cargo run`. Then access `http://localhost:8080`. Default host is `0.0.0.0`
- You may setup custom port as well with `PORT=80`. Default port is `8080`. However, front page uses `8080` port, so you should use default port.

After starting a server, access `http://localhost:8080/up`. All set if you see `You're up!!` message.
