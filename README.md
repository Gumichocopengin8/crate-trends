Crate Trends helps compare multiple Rust Packages

## Description

[Crate Trends](https://crate-trends.herokuapp.com/) ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€

Although Crates.io is a useful tool to find crates, it is difficult to compare multiple crates in term of a number of downloads, license, updated dates, etc...
Crate Trends solve the problems.
